# EMI Verify Deployment Setup Complete ✅

## 🔑 SSH Key Generated
- **Private Key**: `~/.ssh/emi_verify_deploy_key`
- **Public Key**: `~/.ssh/emi_verify_deploy_key.pub`
- **Added to GitHub**: ✅ EMI Verify Deployment Key (Read/write access)

## 🔐 GitHub Secrets Configuration
Your repository has been configured with the following secrets:
- `EC2_HOST` - Your EC2 instance public IP/hostname
- `EC2_USER` - SSH username (usually 'ubuntu' for Ubuntu instances)
- `EC2_SSH_KEY` - The private SSH key content

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Purpose**: GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- **Triggers**: Push to main branch or manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Runs tests before deployment
  - Only deploys to production on main branch pushes
  - Comprehensive health checks
  - Installs all required dependencies on EC2

### 2. `deploy.sh`
- **Purpose**: Complete deployment script for manual or automated use
- **Features**:
  - Installs Node.js, Docker, and Docker Compose if missing
  - Pulls latest code changes
  - Builds and deploys the application
  - Runs health checks
  - Shows service URLs with public IP

### 3. `setup-ec2.sh`
- **Purpose**: One-time setup script for new EC2 instances
- **Features**:
  - Installs all system dependencies
  - Configures SSH keys
  - Sets up firewall rules
  - Prepares the environment for deployment

### 4. `check-status.sh` (auto-generated)
- **Purpose**: Quick status check for deployed services
- **Usage**: `./check-status.sh`

## 🚀 How Automatic Deployment Works

1. **Push to main branch** triggers GitHub Actions
2. **Tests run** to ensure code quality
3. **If tests pass**, deployment begins
4. **SSH connection** is established to your EC2 instance using your secrets
5. **Latest code** is pulled from the repository
6. **Dependencies** are installed/updated automatically
7. **Application** is built and containers are restarted
8. **Health checks** verify all services are running
9. **Public URLs** are displayed in the deployment logs

## 🌐 Production Service URLs
- **Frontend**: `https://emiverify.insightgridanalytic.com`
- **Email Verification**: `https://emiverify.insightgridanalytic.com/verify-email`
- **Backend API**: `https://emiverify.insightgridanalytic.com/api`
- **PgAdmin**: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP:8080` (internal access only)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes to trigger your first automatic deployment:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add automatic deployment setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor the deployment** in GitHub Actions tab of your repository

3. **Check the deployment logs** to see the public URLs of your services

## 🔧 Manual Deployment (Optional)
If you want to deploy manually on your EC2 instance:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/emi-verify
./deploy.sh
```

## 📊 Monitoring
- **GitHub Actions**: Check deployment status and logs
- **EC2 Instance**: Run `./check-status.sh` for quick health check
- **Application Logs**: `docker-compose logs -f`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- **Deployment fails**: Check GitHub Actions logs
- **Services not accessible**: Verify EC2 security groups allow traffic on ports 3000, 3001, 8080
- **Database issues**: Check `docker-compose logs postgres`
- **SSH issues**: Verify EC2_SSH_KEY secret contains the complete private key

Your EMI Verify application is now ready for automatic deployment! 🎉
